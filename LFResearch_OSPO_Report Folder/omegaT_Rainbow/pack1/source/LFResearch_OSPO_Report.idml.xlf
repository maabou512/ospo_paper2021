<source xml:lang="en-US">In our fourth TODO Group survey of open source practices, we found a positive evolution of the OSPO toward more professional organizations with greater dedicated funding and resources. This evolution fits the ongoing theme of  continued growth and acceptance of OSS and development practices in organizations large and small. To gain more qualitative insights into how OSPOs were evolving, we interviewed leaders of noted OSPO programs, including some of the most influential technology firms, such as Red Hat, Microsoft, and VMware, as well as some one of the most iconic transportation brands and one of the largest media and entertainment companies. We asked them how their programs started and how they have evolved. Based on these interviews and the survey data, we mapped out a five-stage OSPO maturity model, from (1) using OSS coincidentally to (2) addressing <g id="1" ctype="x-empty" equiv-text="&lt;content-1>">compliance</g> and license issues to (3) encouraging participation to (4) contributing code, and finally, to (5) incubating and open-sourcing meaningful projects. In this report, we detail each of these stages and develop a handful of archetypes of OSPO organizations. As part of the process, we conducted three case studies of the <g id="2" ctype="x-empty" equiv-text="&lt;content-2>">evolution</g> of three OSPOs in three different sectors—media, financial services, and transportation—each case structured as a journey through the stages of the OSPO. More than a couple decades into the OSPO movement, the role of the OSPO has grown to become a central source of expertise and a strong voice in developing and implementing technology strategy at the world’s forward-thinking companies.</source>

<target xml:lang="ja-JP">Comcast moved to the contribution stage of the OSPO maturity cycle soon after, when company developers began to contribute code to open source projects and Comcast established an Open Source Advisory Council. To properly measure impact on open source, Comcast began tracking contributions in 2013. In the very first year, the company’s employees tallied 13 contributions. Comcast entered its next phase of the maturity cycle a few years later, when the company began to incubate and release projects to the public, starting with Apache Traffic Control. Since then, Comcast has not only contributed to several projects used by the company, but has also posted dozens of open source repositories on GitHub and released multiple projects.</target>

The first goal is to make it as frictionless as possible for Comcast developers to consume, contribute, comply with, work on, and create open source. The second goal is to be supportive and engaged with the broad open source community by giving back, actively engaging with it, and helping the community innovate faster. This also helps Comcast attract and retain talented open source developers into the company.  Notes Ruff, “A lot of our engineers love being able to contribute to OSS, and being able to speak at conferences, and publish papers and blogs. Our job is to make it easy to make it work in OSS.

Those Cs are “communications, consumption, contribution, collaboration, compliance and culture, all key attributes of developing in the open and building healthy open source ecosystems. The Cs inform Comcast open source practices, from working with other companies in the TODO Group and OpenChain to participating and sponsoring open source foundations, to creating an internal mindset and culture of open source. For example, to become more collaborative, Comcast joined the Linux and Apache Foundations and began to seek leadership roles in those bodies and to attend more events. Comcast took an inventory of OSS usage and dependencies early in starting the OSPO to understand better where the dependencies were and communities to support and work with. “That inventory guided us to where we should be spending our resources for collaboration and contributions,” says Ruff.</source>

This approach differs from the siloed model of software development with teams working on projects, sometimes duplicating efforts. Inner sourcing was, in effect, an endorsement of open source practices and an attempt to adopt those that would accelerate software innovation inside companies. However, as a rule, inner source software is usually proprietary, not intended for publication via an open source license. That said, inner sourcing software may be a test run for later open-sourcing the same software. Companies such as PayPal and Comcast have active inner source programs and inner source evangelists. Inner source often collaborates closely with or even works under OSPO management. The two approaches are generally seen as neighboring points on the software development continuum. </source>
